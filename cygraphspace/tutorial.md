# Tutorial

To use the CyGraphSpace app, you first need to install the app. Follow the instructions [here](https://cygraphspace.github.io/#/cygraphspace/README?id=installation).

After you've installed the app, you'll see the CyGraphSpace icon on the Cytoscape Toolbar.

You'll find the option to import the network under `File>Import>Network>Public Databases`

Before you can use CyGraphSpace, you'll need to create a GraphSpace account. If you already have an account on GraphSpace, you can skip this step.

Go to [www.graphspace.org](http://www.graphspace.org) and click on Create Account.

Then, login to the account.

Now, go to Cytoscape and create a new network. Then click on CyGraphSpace icon to export the network. You'll first need to login to GraphSpace.

Then, you'll be asked for confirmation before uploading. Check if the username and graph's name are correct.

Now, you'll be able to view the uploaded graph on GraphSpace.

Now, you can try to import this graph to Cytoscape. Go to the Import Graph menu and login to GraphSpace.

Then, click on Import to Cytoscape to import the network.

To view the graph in the browser instead click on Open in GraphSpace.
